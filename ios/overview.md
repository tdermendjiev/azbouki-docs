The Azbouki iOS SDK gives developers better visibility on what is happening on the user's device. It aims to make troubleshooting easier and bugs resolutions faster.

It uses the Sentry SDK as an event collecting mechanism and integrates seamlessly with it. If you don't have Sentry added to your project it will be added as a dependency of Azbouki.

### Features:
1. Screenshot layout debugging
2. Capture user session video
